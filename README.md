# Travel Agency Site

Hi!
This is a project I reproduced to practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills.

## Preview

**You can see the project [here](https://debbywar.github.io/site-viagens/)!**


Interesting things I could learn:
- **Flexbox concepts** such as Flex-direction, Align-items and Justfy-content.
- How to **integrate with Google Maps**.
- **Media queries:** The entire site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.


The original project was developed by Isadora Stangarlin, on the youtube channel  [Papo de Dev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhKK6VrISnIWPJjYxBPKnA)
